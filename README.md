# Collaborative Filtering using KNN

A simple example of using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to perform user based collaborative filtering to predict the rating of an item that the user has not rated yet that other users have.

Run of code in Spyder:

We would expect the predicted rating to be around a 4 so very cool that it got close.
Again, super simple, but I think its cool :3
